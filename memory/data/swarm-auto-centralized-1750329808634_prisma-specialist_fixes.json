  "summary": "Fixed all Prisma naming convention issues (aiAnalysis -> aIAnalysis, etc.) and some undefined variables. However, discovered critical schema mismatches where the code expects fields and relations that don't exist in the Prisma schema. The application will likely fail at runtime when trying to create or query cases."
