## Quick Start

### Development Environment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment development --strategy rolling
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment staging --strategy blue-green
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production --strategy canary --approval-required
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --to-version <version>
```

## Deployment Strategies

1. **Rolling Deployment**: Default for development
2. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Recommended for staging
3. **Canary Deployment**: Required for production
4. **Immediate Rollback**: Emergency procedures

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Kubernetes cluster access configured
- Terraform installed (v1.0+)
- AWS/GCP/Azure CLI configured
- Ansible installed (for configuration management)

## Security Considerations

- All secrets are managed through secure secret management systems
- Infrastructure changes require approval workflows
- Deployment logs are encrypted and audited
- Network security groups are automatically configured

## Support

For deployment issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide in `docs/troubleshooting/` or contact the DevOps team.
